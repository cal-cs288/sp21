## Description

This course will explore current statistical techniques for the automatic analysis of natural (human) language data. The dominant modeling paradigm is corpus-driven statistical learning.  This term, we are introducing a few new projects to give increased hands-on experience with a greater variety of NLP tasks and commonly used techniques.

This course assumes a good background in basic machine learning and a strong ability to program in Python. Prior experience with linguistics or natural languages is helpful, but not required.  There will be a lot of statistics, algorithms, and coding in this class.  The recommended background is CS 188 (or CS 281A) and CS 170 (or CS 270).  An A in CS 188 (or CS 281A) is required.  This course will be more work-intensive than most graduate or undergraduate courses.

## Readings

The primary recommended texts for this course are:

- Jurafsky and Martin, Speech and Language Processing, [3rd edition](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/).
- Eisenstein, [Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf)

Both texts are currently free online. 

## Office Hours

Professor office hours: TBA

## Late Work Policy

Everyone will have 7 slip days they may use on any project throughout the semester, but you may only use up to 2 slip days on an individual project without prior consent from the instructors. 

If you need to use more than 2 slip days on a project, please make a private post on piazza before the project deadline to let us know.

Slip days will be counted by rounding up to the nearest day -- ie. if a project is due at 11:59pm on Tuesday and you submit at 12:00am on Wednesday, this will use up one of your slip days. Weekend days will count towards slip days as well, so there is no notion of business days here.
